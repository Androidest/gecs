# ITEMS
> Taken from https://gamefaqs.gamespot.com/snes/563219-zombies-ate-my-neighbors/faqs/19111

The special items can be very useful, but often only in specific situations.
Here is some information on how best to use them:

## FIRST AID KIT 
Fills your health bar. I recommend using it when your
health falls to two-tenths of the bar, in most cases; but when you're in an
area containing Jelly Blobs, you should use one as soon as your health falls to
three-tenths of the bar, as that's how much damage the Jelly Blobs deal in
total with one of their Jelly Bomb attacks.

## SPEED SHOES 
Allow you to run across land at twice your normal speed for 15
seconds after you use them. They're therefore very useful for approaching
Victims who are likely to be in danger, very quickly; in particular, there are
a few occasions throughout the game in which Speed Shoes are very useful in
getting to Tourist-Werewolves before the time limit is up. (If you need to use
Speed Shoes directly at the start of the level, a notice at the end of the
previous level's walkthrough will tell you that you need to prepare.) The only
problem with the Speed Shoes is that it can be difficult to collect the Victims
when you've actually got to them, because your control over your high-speed
character is so much less accurate.

## PANDORA'S BOXES 
Little golden chests; when opened they let out energy
blasts which whiz around the screen for a fraction of a second, dealing damage
to Monsters. Although weak Monsters will usually be killed, and tough Monsters
will usually take a dent to their health, you cannot predict exactly whom the
blasts will target. In particular, some enemies, like Frankenstein's Monster,
are barely ever targeted.

Apart from their use as an offensive weapon against bosses, Pandora's Boxes can
also be used to defend Victims that are in danger as you approach. For example,
let's say you have to approach a Baby who's in the northeast corner of the
level, in the middle of a Zombie spawning area, from around the wall. As you
approach, a Zombie rises up and heads for the Baby; you can't kill the Zombie
with your Water Pistol, but you can with a Pandora's Box. The only thing wrong
with this is that sometimes, the bolts of energy don't get to the Monster you
particularly want killed (in time), so the Victim dies anyway.

## MONSTER POTION: 
The red liquid in the laboratory flask transforms you into a
Purple Monster for about 35 seconds. While in Purple Monster form, you are
invulnerable, but you can deal considerable and repeated damage to Monsters
with your punch attack - press the A, B, X or Y buttons. The punch will also
bring down regular doors and weak sections of wall, etc. as the Bazooka does.
The Monster Potion is very useful for fighting tough Monsters, particularly
bosses; and also for fighting *through* Monsters if you want to get somewhere
fast, and not worry about taking damage. Note that as the Purple Monster, you
cannot open Skull Doors, you cannot swim, and you cannot use trampolines.

## GHOST POTION: 
The blue liquid in the laboratory flask turns you into a ghost
for about 25 seconds. While in ghost form, you are invulnerable, and you can
also walk across the surface of water. This makes it useful for approaching
Victims without having to worry about being held up by Monsters, or by having
to dive into the water. This is most useful in areas containing Squidmen, as
they can get to Victims very quickly, whether in the water or not, and so you
need to be able to as well. Note that as a ghost, you cannot use weapons, open
any doors, or use trampolines.

## MYSTERY POTION 
Is a laboratory flask overlaid with a question mark. It
can have any of six effects. The random nature of Mystery Potions makes them
unsuitable for critical uses such as helping you to save Victims, but they can
be useful when fighting bosses, as a time-wasting tactic; as a source of random
health boosts; and for the occasional Purple Monster transformation. The six
effects of the Mystery Potion are as follows:

- You are turned into the Purple Monster, as with the Monster Potion.
- You are turned into a ghost, as with the Ghost Potion.
- Your speed increases, as with the Speed Shoes.
- Your health bar is filled, as with the First Aid Kit.
- You lose some of your health (you will never fall below two-tenths of your
   health bar as a result of using the Mystery Potion, though).
- You turn into Mr. Hyde.

### Mr. Hyde 
Mr. Hyde  is an evil alternate form for yourself; you know that you have turned
into him when your skin and clothes change to sickly colours and
skull-and-crossbones icons appear in your weapon status bar. You have no direct
control over Mr. Hyde; he walks around randomly, and if he gets near to a
Victim (or the second player), he will dash over at high speed and kill him (or
deal him damage). It seems that if you press the directional controls, you may
be able to influence Mr Hyde's movement in a very limited way, but he will just
as often purposely disobey you as he will obey, so don't count on being able to
steer him away from trouble. You remain as Mr. Hyde for about **25** seconds.

## DECOY CLOWNS 
Inflatable clown toys that act as substitute Victims,
drawing Monsters' attention away from you and the real Victims. They will
occupy the Monsters' attention until they burst. Unmolested, the Clowns last
about 17 seconds, but when under attack they will burst rather more quickly
(the exact time depending simply upon how they are attacked). You can only have
three Decoy Clowns inflated on the level at any one time.
